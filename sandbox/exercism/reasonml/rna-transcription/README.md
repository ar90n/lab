# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Building and testing
You will need the node package manager (npm) installed - download from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
There is one time setup for each exercise, which may take a few minutes:
```
npm install
```

Open two shells, and in the first, start the build process.
```
npm start
```

In the second, start the tests running.
```
npm test
```

As you edit the code, the two processes will continually rebuild and rerun the tests.
